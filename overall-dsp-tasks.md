# Task List: DSP Documentation Agent Implementation with n8n

## Relevant Files

### n8n Configuration & Workflows

- `~/.n8n/workflows/dsp-agent-workflow.json` - Main n8n workflow definition
- `~/.n8n/credentials.json` - API credentials storage (auto-managed by n8n)
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker setup for n8n (if using Docker deployment)

### Documentation & Data

- `docs/dsp-wiki/` - Directory for scraped DSP documentation
- `docs/prompts/system-prompt.md` - Agent system prompt and personality
- `docs/test-questions.md` - Validation questions for testing

### MCP Server Configurations

- `mcp-configs/ragdocs-config.json` - MCP RAG server configuration
- `mcp-configs/brave-search-config.json` - Brave Search MCP configuration

### Scripts & Utilities

- `scripts/scrape-dsp-docs.js` - Script to gather DSP documentation
- `scripts/test-agent.js` - Testing script for agent responses
- `scripts/backup-workflow.sh` - Backup n8n workflows

### Notes

- n8n stores workflows internally but they can be exported as JSON for version
  control
- Most configuration happens visually in n8n's interface, reducing the need for
  code files
- MCP servers run as separate processes that n8n connects to via Execute Command
  nodes
- Use environment variables in n8n for API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, Brave)
