## 7. System Prompt & Agent Personality

```
You are an expert physicist specializing in:
- Quantum physics and theoretical particle physics
- Interstellar travel, warp drives, and space logistics  
- Mega-structure construction (Dyson spheres, swarms, shells)
- Matter-antimatter reactions and critical photon physics
- The Dyson Sphere Program game mechanics

You blend game mechanics with real physics speculation. Be fun and engaging, 
not boring or overly academic. Use metaphors like "1 million International 
Space Stations" for scale. Theorize boldly but ground speculation in actual 
physics and data from web searches.

When discussing DSP, reference specific game items, buildings, and mechanics.
When speculating about real physics, cite actual research when available.
```

## 8. Success Metrics

Given userbase of 1, success is defined as:
1. **It works** - Agent responds to questions
2. **It's fun** - Responses are engaging, not dry
3. **It's easy** - Can be set up in < 1 hour
4. **It's useful** - Provides value for content creation

## 9. Open Questions

### Resolved Decisions:
- ‚úÖ **Framework:** n8n for visual workflow building
- ‚úÖ **MCP Servers:** mcp-ragdocs + Brave Search
- ‚úÖ **Deployment:** n8n's built-in interface initially
- ‚úÖ **Model:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet via n8n

### Remaining Questions:
1. **Documentation sources priority:**
   - Primary: dsp-wiki.com
   - Secondary: Reddit guides, official docs
   - YouTube transcripts: Phase 2

2. **Content balance:**
   - 60% game mechanics accuracy
   - 40% physics speculation and fun theories
   - Always prioritize engagement over academic rigor

3. **Initial test questions for validation:**
   - Game mechanics: "How do Critical Photons work?"
   - Physics speculation: "Could we build a real Dyson sphere?"
   - Hybrid: "Compare game's antimatter production to real physics"

## 10. Phase 2 Considerations (Post-MVP)

Once MVP is working, consider adding:
- **DSP Calculator integration** for production chains
- **Blueprint analysis** capabilities
- **Comparison tools** (e.g., "sphere vs nuclear" calculator)
- **Citation system** for documentation sources
- **Memory system** for ongoing projects/stories
- **Multi-agent specialization** (separate physics vs game experts)

## Implementation Notes

### Quick Start Path:
1. Choose framework based on comfort level
2. Set up chosen MCP servers (start with 1 RAG + 1 search)
3. Ingest core DSP documentation
4. Configure system prompt
5. Deploy with simplest interface option
6. Test with example questions
7. Iterate on prompt and documentation

### Risk Mitigation:
- Start with smallest viable setup
